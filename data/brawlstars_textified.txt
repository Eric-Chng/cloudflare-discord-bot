Draft info for the map modifier quickfire. To play the map modifier quickfire: - Modifier > Map. Regain 0.3 ammo per projectile that hits an enemy. Abuse brawlers that shoot out a lot of projectiles with one ammo.
- Big three brawlers are Gene, Gale, and Leon
- Any type of thrower (except Grom), Angelo, Bibi, Bo, Brock, Doug, Frank, Hank, Jacky, Kenji, Kit, Lily, Mico, Mortis, and Squeak do not benefit from Quickfire
- Generally avoid tanks as it is harder to move up with other brawlers being able to spam more shots
Draft info for the map modifier timed detonation. To play the map modifier timed detonation: - Map slowly breaks before going overtime halfway through. Open map meta overrides any preexisting mode/map meta, but draft 1 mode relevant brawlers.
- Angelo, Piper, Melodie, Nani, Belle, Fang, 8-bit, Mandy, Brock, R-T
Draft info for the map modifier big friend. To play the map modifier big friend: - Your team is set to the health of highest hp brawler on your team. Tanky brawler + high dps is good. Still play the map/mode meta a little.

Draft info for the map modifier sick beats. To play the map modifier sick beats: - Modifier > Map. All brawlers are immune to stuns and slows. Asassins and tank counters that do not rely on CC become way better. 
- Notable edge cases: Meg (doesn't self stun when losing big form), Charlie (super works), Gene (super works), Kit (super on enemy works)

Draft info for the map modifier second wind. To play the map modifier second wind: - Wherever you die, respawn after 7 seconds (longer). Breaks hotzone/heist meta. Brawl ball more like knockout because you can't defend after team wipe

Draft info for the map modifier gadgets galore. To play the map modifier gadgets galore: - Map > Modifier. Gadgets have unlimited uses but they have a 15 second cooldown instead of 5. Brawlers with good gadgets get a little better but meta doesn't change much. Do NOT use Gadget Charge Gear.
