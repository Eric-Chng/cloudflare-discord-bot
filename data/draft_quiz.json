        "notes": "Common guesses of Nani, Brock, Grom and Larry & Lawrie are all losing - both of your lanes have bad matchups and the enemy team theoretically has a guaranteed Blue Star with Angelo's gadget; This means you've got to play more aggressive and try to shake up the position, rather than hope for the best with subpar lanes.",

        "notes": "The enemy composition lends itself into stacking up due to Berry's high healing and great AoE attack, forcing your team to bunch up as well due to Mortis posing a threat to Sprout otherwise. The grouping makes picks like R-T/Darryl harder to play as solo laners.",
