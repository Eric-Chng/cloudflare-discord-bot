        "answer": "Mortis. Other picks: Kenji, Carl.",
        "notes": "Common guesses of Nani, Brock, Grom and Larry & Lawrie are all losing - both of your lanes have bad matchups and the enemy team theoretically has a guaranteed Blue Star with Angelo's gadget; This means you've got to play more aggressive and try to shake up the position, rather than hope for the best with subpar lanes.",

        "answer": "Lou. Other picks: Maisie. R-T prob good too",
        "notes": "The enemy composition lends itself into stacking up due to Berry's high healing and great AoE attack, forcing your team to bunch up as well due to Mortis posing a threat to Sprout otherwise. The grouping makes picks like R-T/Darryl harder to play as solo laners.",

        "answer": "Janet. Other picks: Ruffs, Tara, Jessie",
        "notes": "Clear Janet game - she does well on Gem Fort into all 3 of the enemy brawlers, kind of a no brainer. Ruffs and Tara are also great option for sidelaners as they can block Lou shots, Gene pulls and deal with Leon up close. Of course, Jessie is also a fine pick due to her turret, but they're all secondary to Janet.",

        "answer": "Leon. Other picks: Gray",
        "notes": "Once again we are looking at Shooting Star with difficult lanes - the big problem is obviously the R-T. Leon's purpose is to help pressure him back from mid or by stacking with Nani on it; Not the easiest of teamcomps to play, but surprisingly effective. Secondary to Leon is the Gray pick due to his synergy with Gus's shield, though it's a pretty tough matchups execute quick kills at a high level.",

        "answer": "Darryl. Other picks: Lola",
        "notes": "Pretty clear scenario - blue has 2 controllers with low damage and Chuck, therefore killing Darryl is a big issue for them as it's basically impossible without letting Colette and Penny onto the safe. Lola is also viable due to simply having a great matchup into the enemy defence.",
