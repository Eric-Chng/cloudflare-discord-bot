    "Gem Grab 2v2": "Some good brawlers are Penny, Stu, Amber, Juju",
    "Knockout 2v2": "Gene, Piper, Angelo, R-T, Gus, Kit+Darryl Cheese",
    "Hotzone 2v2": "Spen didn't make a video but this map is toxic with water and a narrow zone for non-amphibious brawlers. Wall breaks can help you open map to attack on left side (if you're long range) or make it easier to defend on right side. Often a rock paper scissors of matchups with snipers, tanks, throwers, and control brawlers all being viable.\n Some brawlers to try out are Juju, Surge, Buzz, Lou, Draco, Penny, Pearl, Stu, Darryl, R-T (head can go on water), Brock, Bo, Frank + Berry (Frank goes left)"
